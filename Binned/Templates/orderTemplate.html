        We got your order [username](thank you!). This is your confirmation that everything's going according to plan, so print it and file it away somewhere safe. Just kidding.<br/>
        Please allow up to 7-10 days processing time before your order ships. You will receive a shipment confirmation email when your order has shipped from our warehouse. Thanks for your patience.
